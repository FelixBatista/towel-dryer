# Towel Dryer

> This is a hardware thing designed to dry towels in a bathroom. It detects that a towel was hanged by ,easuring the humidity change. After that, it turns on a resistance.
> Its a firmware coded in C/C++ and uses the Mongoose OS framework.
> A silicon resistance, an ESP32 and a DHT is required for this project.

### Next steps

This project is still under development:

- [x] Create the hardware thing 
- [x] Add electronics to hardware
- [x] Code the firmware
- [ ] Correct the resistance temperature surge
